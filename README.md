`SnakeGame.exe` is the game file and technically the only one required to run, just execute that and you'll be right in snake :)

`OpenSans-Regular.ttf` is required if you want to see the score in the background.

`SnakeGame.zip` has both of those files for an easy download.

Arrow keys for movement. Collect the red dots to increase your length and score. If you run into the wall, the game resets. If you run into yourself, you cut your tail off and lose the length of your tail in points. If you run into yourself 3 times, the game resets.
